Welcome!

My full name is Rodrigo Palacios. A mouthful, I know, so I'm o.k.
with just Rod. I do partime webdev. I'm a CSci undergraduate veering 
towards natural language processing as well as automatic information
extraction via unsupervised classification algorithms (currently co-
authoring a paper with Tim Weninger, the topic of which was inspired
by an algorithm I posted on reddit). On my free time, I'm hacking 
something up, or working on simplifying AI/ML material to an absurdly
understandable level.
