Welcome!
===

My full name is Rodrigo Palacios. A mouthful, I know, so I'm o.k.
with just Rod. I do partime webdev. I'm a CSci undergraduate veering 
towards natural language processing as well as automatic information
extraction via unsupervised classification algorithms (currently 
co-authoring a paper with [Tim Weninger](http://www3.nd.edu/~tweninge/), 
the topic of which was inspired by an algorithm I posted on 
[reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/2ppyot/just_made_what_i_consider_my_first_algorithm_it/)). 
On my free time, I'm hacking something up, or working on simplifying 
AI/ML material to an absurdly understandable level.
