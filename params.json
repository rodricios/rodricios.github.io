{"name":"rodri.cios","tagline":"Let's not complicate things","body":"###Hi, I'm Rodrigo\r\n\r\nYou can contact me either by email: rodrigopala91@gmail.com\r\n\r\nor by twitter: [@rodricios](https://twitter.com/rodricios). \r\n\r\n####Brief\r\n\r\nI, like probably many of you, want to and like to get things done. If you're hiring, or would like an extra competent mind (my opinion) to collaborate with, to try and solve some problem you or your team are having (let's assume this is a catch-all statement where \"problem\" can be almost anything), or simply want to exchange thoughts, get a hold of me via one of the above mentioned methods. \r\n\r\n####Projects \r\n\r\n[eatiht](https://github.com/rodricios/eatiht) - An unsupervised content classifier; great for extracting articles from web pages. Demo can be found in link. \r\n\r\n[autocomplete](https://github.com/rodricios/autocomplete) - An adult and kid friendly exercise in creating a predictive program. I try to express the intuition behind [Markov chains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) by thought-experimenting my way towards the autocomplete/query-suggester akin to iPhone's, Google's. \r\n\r\n[Backtesting content extractors](https://github.com/rodricios/crawl-to-the-future) - A repo containing a manually/systematically curated test set of web pages from the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 (thanks to [Internet Archive's WayBack Machine](https://archive.org/web/). This dataset is being used for further testing and opinion-making. Currently in progress and with the generous help of [Tim Weninger](http://www3.nd.edu/~tweninge/). \r\n\r\n####My passions\r\n\r\nI'm \"passionate\" about simplified solutions for both ordinary and non-ordinary problems. This \"passion\" sometimes spills over to the realm of what the educated world calls \"machine learning.\" In cleaning up this \"passion\" spillover, I found a new passion: \"simplified\" \"machine learning\". \r\n\r\nI apologize for my indiscriminate use of double quotes. \r\n\r\n####My likes\r\n\r\nI enjoy mild to moderately mild deadpan humor.
